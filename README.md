# House Price Prediction

## Description:

This project is to develop a predictive model that accurately estimates house prices based on various features such as location, size, number of rooms, and other relevant factors. The model will be built using the **Random Forest Regressor algorithm**.

## Tech Stack:

Language:  Python 
Algorithm: Random Forest Regression
Tools:  Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn.

## Methodology:

###  Data Collection:
- Gather a dataset containing historical house prices and their features from reliable sources such as real estate websites or public databases.

###  Data Preprocessing:
- Handle missing values, outliers, and categorical variables.
- Normalize or standardize numerical features wherever required.

###  Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
- Visualize the distribution of house prices and other features.
- Identify correlations between features and house prices.
- Generate insights that can guide feature selection and engineering.

###  Model Training:
- Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
- Train a **Random Forest Regressor** model on the training set.
- Evaluate the model's performance on the testing set using Mean Absolute Error(MAE) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE).

###  Model Fine-Tuning:
- Perform **Hyperparameter tuning** to optimize the model's performance.
- Use techniques such as cross-validation to ensure the model's robustness.
